Ch.py
=====

Description
-----------
An event-based library for connecting to _ONE_ Chatango room, has support for several things including: messaging, message font, name color, deleting, banning, recent history, 2 userlist modes, flagging, avoiding flood bans, detecting flags.
Event-based does not mean that this is asynchronous, though, it still uses a thread for the ping loop, but that shouldn't cause much overhead... I hope.

Installation
------------
	# python setup.py install

Compatibility
-------------
Python 3 and Python 2.

Examples
--------
There's currently only one, example.py, but I'm sure the source was documented enough for you to look at that.

License
-------
This has been released under the GPLv3 license.
